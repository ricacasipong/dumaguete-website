    <h2 class="h"><b>DUMAGUETE BOULEVARD</b></h2>
    <p class="p">Perhaps one of the most iconic tourist spots in Dumaguete is the Dumaguete Boulevard, also known as the 
        Rizal Boulevard. This bustling waterfront strip is packed with bars, restaurants and vendors, from ice cream 
        carts to tempura stands. The Dumaguete Boulevard is in the heart of the city, less than a kilometre from the 
        port, and overlooks the vast sea and Siquijor Island in the distance. It's a beautiful spot to visit in the 
        evenings for a stroll under the ornamental street lamps, to try the famous Dumaguete tempura and to stop for 
        dinner at one of the boulevard restaurants.

    <h2 class="h"><b>DUMAGUETE BELFRY TOWER</b></h2>
    <p class="p">The Dumaguete Belfry is a historical tourist spot in Dumaguete city, right in the very centre of town. 
        It's hard to miss, given its size, and is often surrounded by tourists, religious faithfuls, vendors and beggars. 
        The Dumaguete Belfry has stood since the 1760s, serving as a watchtower to look out for pirates and invaders. 
        Now, with pirates no longer a threat, the belfry is a religious site and a place to pay respects.

    <h2 class="h"><b>SILLIMAN UNIVERSITY</b></h2>
    <p class="p">Dumaguete is ironically both a retirement city and a university city, with Silliman University 
        taking centre stage as a major Dumaguete tourist spot. Ranked within the top 10 universities in the Philippines, 
        Silliman University is a popular choice for students near and far. Built in 1901, it's also a beautiful campus 
        that warrants a look around while you're in town. Unfortunately, the campus was closed the entire time we were 
        there because of the pandemic, so we had no choice but to admire from afar, but normally you can wander through 
        the historical grounds.

    <h2 class="h"><b>QUEZON PARK</b></h2>
    <p class="p">Quezon Park is a large green space in the heart of the city, directly across from the Dumaguete Belfry. 
        Known for being one of the most popular places to visit in Dumaguete, Quezon Park was built to honour Manuel L. 
        Quezon, the 2nd President of the Philippines. There are historical statues around the park, as well as a large 
        pavilion to take shelter from the sun. It's a popular park with families and kids and is worth a stroll through 
        if you've just visited the Dumaguete Belfry across the road. Keep in mind, there are often a lot of homeless 
        people around Quezon Park.

    <h2 class="h"><b>SAINT CATHERINE OF ALEXANDRIA CATHEDRAL</b></h2>
    <p class="p">In the same area as the Dumaguete Belfry tower and Quezon Park sits the St Catherine of Alexandra 
        Cathedral. You don't have to be Catholic to appreciate the intricacy and architectural beauty of this building. 
        Inside the Dumaguete Cathedral you'll find elaborate artwork, glittering chandeliers and people from all walks 
        of life coming to worship and admire.
