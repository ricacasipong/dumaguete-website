    <p class="p">"Dumaguete" was coined from the Cebuano word daggit, which means "to snatch". The word dumaguet, meaning
         "to swoop", was coined because of the area's frequent raids by Moro pirates and its power to attract and
          keep visitors, both local and foreign. In 1572, Diego López Povedano indicated the place as Dananguet,
           but cartographer Pedro Murillo Velarde in 1734 already used the present name of Dumaguete for the settlement.</p>
